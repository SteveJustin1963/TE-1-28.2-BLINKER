Have you seen the blinking lights at the roadside to warn motorists of roadworks or an excavation? These lights turn off during the day and begin to operate only at dusk. They contain 1 or 2 lantern batteries, a Light-DependentResistor and a 2-transistor flasher. The main requirement for a circuit to operate this type of warning device (apart from creating the flashes) is for its daytime current to be as low as possible to conserve battery. Since the flash of the globe is extremely short, the average current drawn from the battery will be quite small. This circuit achieves both of these requirements.  The stand-by current is only 100microamp and the average operating current is less than 25 milliamps. The only two critical components in the circuit are the 10 ohm resistor and globe. The resistor must be 10 ohms. A 5 ohm or 15 ohm resistor will not work. The lamp must be a low current type. A miniature model railway globe of about 3v - 4v is ideal. It must be rated at .05 to .1 amp to operate successfully. Ordinary torch globes of 2.5v @ 300ma will not work at all. Use a light dependent resistor type ORP12 or Similar which has a dark resistance of 10M and a light resistance of 300 ohms.
